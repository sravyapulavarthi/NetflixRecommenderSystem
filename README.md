# Netflix Movie Recommender System

This project aims to build a movie recommendation mechanism within Netflix. The dataset I used here come directly from Netflix. It consists of 4 text data files, each file contains over 20M rows, i.e. over 4K movies and 400K customers. All together over 17K movies and 500K+ customers!

The movie rating files contain over 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous Netflix customers over 17 thousand movie titles. The data were collected between October, 1998 and December, 2005 and reflect the distribution of all ratings received during this period. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5 (integral) stars. To protect customer privacy, each customer ID has been replaced with a randomly-assigned id.  The date of each rating and the title and year of release for each movie id are also provided.
